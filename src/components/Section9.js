            <p>
                If you look closely, human potential/effort is the 
                only true scarce resource on this planet, to the
                 extent that everything on this planet is valued in terms of the
                 human effort that has gone in building/acquiring that thing.
                <br />
                <br />

                Yet the fact that most of us can’t directly invest in human potential makes absolutely no sense to us.
